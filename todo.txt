Add a field to the add book phase which asks the user how many times he'd wanna save a particular book

Add a right click feature to the searched results so that a user can directly borrow after searching for a book

Update the borrower table since a user can borrow multiple books hence changing the primary key to an autoincrement
instead of the student_id
